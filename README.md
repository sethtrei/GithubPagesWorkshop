# What is GitHub Pages?
GitHub Pages is a way of using a GitHub repository to make a website.
By the end of the workshop you will have a link to get you to your website.

# Create a Repository
Make a repository following this format:
(yourusername).github.io

So if your username is supersam, your repository would be supersam.github.io
