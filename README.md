# Cloud9 tutorial

## What is Cloud9?

*Cloud9 is a website that lets you program online*. Traditionally, all
 programming was done locally on the computer: you would save your files on your
 computer and edit them on your computer (with a code editor). Cloud9 allows you
 to save your files online and edit your files online (Cloud9 also has a code
 editor). This means all you need to start programming is internet and a
 browser. No more installing software!

__Imporatant__: if you're having trouble, checkout the
[troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section at the end of the workshop.

## Login with GitHub

First, make sure you have a github account. If you don't have one, follow the
guide for making one located
[here](https://github.com/hackedu/hackedu/tree/master/playbook/workshops/portfolio#creating-a-github-account).

Now that you have a GitHub account, you can login to Cloud9 with GitHub. Go to
http://c9.io and click on the "octocat" icon in the top corner, as demonstrated
below:

## Create a new workspace

To create a new workspace you can either select the create a new workspace
option under workspaces, or click the new workspace button at the top right of
your screen.

Next set your workspace name to *html-css-javascript-basics*, and your
description to *Learning to use html css and javascript together*. Make your
workspace public, skip the *Clone from Git or Mercurial URL* option and set your
template to *Custom*. Finally click the *Create Workspace* button at the bottom
of your page and you should be prompted to this screen.

## Using HTML CSS and Javascript together in Cloud9

First we will create a new folder. To do this right click the workspace bar on
the left and select *New Folder*. You can name this folder whatever you like.

Next we will be creating a html file. To do this hit file on the top left of
your screen, hover over the *New From Template* option, and select *HTML file*.
Now we want to save this file in the new folder we just created. To do this go
to *file* and click *save as*. Name your file *index.html* and save it inside
the folder you just created.

Repeat the last step twice more, except this time create a CSS file and a
Javascript file. Name your files *style.css* and *index.js*
